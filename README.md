# cat-directory

A simple front-end application that allows users to search for particular cats based on names from a pre-existing directory. 
The number of cats displayed will narrow down as the user types in more characters of the name in the search bar. 

This project is an inspiration from "Robofriends", a React application from a Zero to Mastery Udemy course. 

This project makes use of the JSON placeholder API and the robohash API.
